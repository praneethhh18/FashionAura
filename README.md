## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (usually comes with Node.js)

### 2. Environment Variables

Before running the project, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add the following line.

```.env
# This is a placeholder for any future environment variables.
# You may need to add Firebase or Genkit API keys here for full functionality.
GEMINI_API_KEY= your gemini api key

```
*Note: For the current build, the AI features with Genkit are mocked or configured to work in a developer environment, but a `GEMINI_API_KEY` would be required for production use.*

*Note: API Key for the several functions are disabled for safety purpose, you can use your own API key for testing(google ai studio).*

### 3. Installation

Clone the repository and install the project dependencies using npm.

```bash
# 1. Install all the required packages
npm install
```

### 4. Running the Application

Once the installation is complete, you can run the development server.

```bash
# 2. Run the development server
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server, typically on port 9002. Open your web browser and navigate to:
[http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002)

You should now see the Fashion Aura homepage live! The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

### 5. Running Tests

This project includes a test suite to ensure the backend API endpoints are working correctly. To run the tests, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
# Run the Jest test suite
npm test
```

Jest will find all test files (ending in `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx`) and run them, showing you the results directly in the terminal.

## üèóÔ∏è Assumptions & Design Choices

Several key decisions were made during the development of this project:

- **Technology Stack**: The project is built on a modern stack centered around Next.js and React. This choice enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and a powerful component-based architecture. Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui were chosen for rapid, utility-first styling and a pre-built, accessible component library.
- **State Management**: For simplicity and to avoid heavy external libraries, client-side state (like the shopping cart and wishlist) is managed using React's built-in Context API. Data is persisted in the browser's `localStorage` to ensure a seamless user experience across sessions.
- **Product Data**: All product information is currently hardcoded within `src/lib/products.ts`. This was done for demonstration purposes to allow for rapid development without a database dependency. In a production environment, this data would be fetched from a database (like Firestore) or a dedicated e-commerce backend.
- **API Simulation**: The checkout process and product API are simulated. The `/api/checkout` endpoint logs the order to the console instead of processing a real payment. The `/api/products` endpoint returns the hardcoded product list. This provides a functional front-to-back flow without requiring external service integrations.
- **AI Integration**: The generative AI features (Shopping Advisor, Customer Support Chat) are powered by Genkit. They are designed to showcase modern AI capabilities within an e-commerce context but run in a developer environment. A production setup would require a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- **Styling**: The visual style, including colors and fonts, is based on the initial project requirements. The theme is implemented using CSS variables within `src/app/globals.css`, making it easy to customize the entire application's look and feel from a central location.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database connection setup

Follow these steps to connect the app to a MongoDB instance (Atlas) for local testing. Do NOT commit secrets ‚Äî keep them in a local `.env.local` file.

1. Create an Atlas cluster
	- Go to <https://cloud.mongodb.com> and create a free cluster.
2. Create a DB user
	- Project ‚Üí Database Access ‚Üí Add new Database User. Give the user `readWrite` access to the app database.
3. Allow network access
	- Project ‚Üí Network Access ‚Üí Add your machine IP (or `0.0.0.0/0` for quick testing only).
4. Copy the connection string
	- Clusters ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí "Connect your application" ‚Üí copy the `mongodb+srv://...` URI.

Local configuration (do not commit)

Create `.env.local` in the project root and add your credentials locally (example):

```text
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<DB_USER>:<DB_PASSWORD>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
MONGODB_DB="fashion-aura"
```

PowerShell one-liner (replace placeholders and run locally):

```powershell
@"
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<DB_USER>:<DB_PASSWORD>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
MONGODB_DB="fashion-aura"
"@ | Out-File -FilePath .env.local -Encoding utf8
```

Run the app locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev -- --port 9002
```

Verify DB writes (example: checkout route)

Use PowerShell (run in a separate shell while the dev server is running):

```powershell
$body = @{ items = @(@{ id='prod-1'; name='Test'; quantity=1; price=100 }); total = 100 } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://localhost:9002/api/checkout' -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType 'application/json'
```

Create DB indexes (run once)

We provide a script `scripts/create-indexes.ts` that creates common indexes used by the app. After setting `.env.local`, run:

```bash
# using ts-node if available
npx ts-node scripts/create-indexes.ts
# or compile the script to JS and run with node
```

Security notes

- Never commit `.env.local` or any secret keys. This project already ignores `.env*` in `.gitignore`.
- If a secret is accidentally exposed, rotate it immediately in Atlas (Database Access ‚Üí Edit user ‚Üí Change password).
- For CI / hosting use the provider's secret manager (Vercel / Netlify / GitHub Actions secrets). Do not store secrets in the repository.

Since this wasn‚Äôt a race, I focused on innovation and detail with a perfect vibe to craft Fashion-Aura with care.  
Thank you for checking out Fashion Aura. Happy coding!
